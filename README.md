# Dynamics, Networks and Computation course

This repository contains my assignments in the course Dynamics, Networks and Computation:

- **Ex1** - This assignment explores the robustness and structure of networks through node removal experiments, MCMC sampling, and edge-swapping methods.
     I analyzed both real and synthetic networks, implemented sampling techniques for the configuration model, and studied uniformity and convergence.
     Key topics include random vs. targeted attacks, phase transitions, power-law degree sequences, and Markov Chain-based graph sampling.
- **Ex2** - This project explores dynamic behaviors in biological systems through computational simulations and analysis. It covers bacterial population growth using stochastic models, simulates feed-forward gene      regulatory networks with and without noise, and implements Hill functions for soft logic gates. The final section models gene regulation in the lac operon and demonstrates how biological systems can mimic a NAND      gate. All simulations and analyses are implemented in Python using numerical methods.
