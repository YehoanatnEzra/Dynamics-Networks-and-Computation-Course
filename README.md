# Dynamics, Networks and Computation – Course Project

This repository contains my work for an assignment in the course Dynamics, Networks and Computation:

Ex1: This project explores the robustness and structure of networks through node removal experiments, MCMC sampling, and edge-swapping methods.
     I analyzed both real and synthetic networks, implemented sampling techniques for the configuration model, and studied uniformity and convergence.
     Key topics include random vs. targeted attacks, phase transitions, power-law degree sequences, and Markov Chain-based graph sampling.
